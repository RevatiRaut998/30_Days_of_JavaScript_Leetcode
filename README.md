# LeetCode – 30 Days of JavaScript Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **30 Days of JavaScript** study plan on LeetCode.  
The goal of this plan is to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals including closures, higher-order functions, asynchronous programming, JSON manipulation, and class-based design.

---

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized by **topic folders**, each containing solution files named according to their **LeetCode problem title**.  
This makes it easy to locate a solution either by topic or by the original LeetCode problem.

Example folder layout:

```
Closures/
├─ 2667_create_hello_world_function.js      // Create Hello World Function
├─ 2620_counter.js                          // Counter
├─ 2704_to_be_or_not_to_be.js               // To Be Or Not To Be
├─ 2665_counter_II.js                       // Counter II
... and other problem files organized similarly by topic and number.
```
> Each file contains a complete, self-contained solution to the corresponding LeetCode problem.
