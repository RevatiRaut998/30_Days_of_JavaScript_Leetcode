# LeetCode â€“ 30 Days of JavaScript Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the **30 Days of JavaScript** study plan on LeetCode.  
The goal of this plan is to strengthen JavaScript fundamentals including closures, higher-order functions, asynchronous programming, JSON manipulation, and class-based design.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository is organized by **topic folders**, each containing solution files named according to their **LeetCode problem number**.  
This makes it easy to locate a solution either by topic or by the original LeetCode problem.

Example folder layout:

```
Closures/
â”œâ”€ 2667.js      // Create Hello World Function
â”œâ”€ 2620.js      // Counter
â”œâ”€ 2704.js      // To Be Or Not To Be
â”œâ”€ 2665.js      // Counter II
... and other problem files organized similarly by topic and number.
```
> Each file contains a complete, self-contained solution to the corresponding LeetCode problem.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo?

- To **practice JavaScript concepts** that often appear in technical interviews.  
- To build a strong reference for **closures, async/await, prototypes, and object manipulation**.  
- To track my **progress** through the LeetCode study plan.

## âš¡ How to Run

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/RevatiRaut998/30_Days_of_JavaScript_Leetcode.git
```

Navigate to the folder and run any solution file:
```
node 2620.js
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Solutions are written in **vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**.
- Code is kept **clean, modular, and commented** for readability.
- This repo is for **learning and reference**, not for direct interview prep dumps.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learning

Completing this challenge improved my ability to:
- Write **idiomatic JavaScript**  
- Solve **real-world frontend interview tasks**  
- Handle **async behavior, debouncing, and memoization** patterns
